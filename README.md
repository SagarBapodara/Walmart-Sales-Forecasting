# Walmart Retail Sales Analysis and Forecasting

## Problem Statement
Sales forecasting is a crucial tool for retail organizations to develop strategies that align with demand and create promotions to enhance sales. Walmart, a billion-dollar American retail giant, operates over 10,000 stores worldwide and more than 4,000 across the United States (ref: https://corporate.walmart.com/about/location-facts). Accurate sales forecasting allows the company to manage inventory, predict revenue, and make informed decisions regarding new investments. Achieving predetermined targets early in the season can positively influence stock prices and shape investors' perceptions. On the other hand, missing these projections could significantly harm stock prices, which would be particularly detrimental for a large company like Walmart.

## Aim
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can forecast store sales based on past sales patterns. With this model, decision-makers can make critical business decisions, maximize revenue, and improve sales in underperforming departments.
